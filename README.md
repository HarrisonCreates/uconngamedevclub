Website (and code) for the Game Development Club at the University of Connecticut

Hello! My name is Harrison Burr, and I'm the developer for this website. Please note my web skills are still developing, so
this README may get updated as new features are implemented.

***PLEASE NOTE***
Any and all vector images used which do not utilize a Creative Commons or WTFPL lisences will be attributed their proper credits.

Any images or non-original work that requests attribution will receive it. I am a firm believer in "Credit where credit is due",
and the last thing I want to use a piece of work without recognizing the skill of an artist or team behind it. These accredidations
will be found in the slide-out menu as final images are sourced, sized, and referenced.

I usually only pull from WTFPL and Creative Commons image sources. If there was a misrepresentation and you are an artist whose
work appears on the site which you did NOT release under a royalty-free lisence, please contact me so I can A.) find or create a
new graphic and B.) Direct you to the source where I found your asset listed as royalty-free so that you can safeguard your work.

---But where do I contact you?---
